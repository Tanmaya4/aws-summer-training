It leverages serverless architecture to provide efficient image storage, retrieval, and management. **The application is currently under development and focuses on core functionalities such as image upload, storage, and display**.

## Architecture
The application follows a serverless architecture with the following components:

* **Frontend:** A NextJs based user interface responsible for image upload and display.
* **Backend:**
  * **API Gateway:** Exposes RESTful APIs for image operations.
  * **Lambda:** Executes serverless functions to handle image processing and interactions with S3.
  * **S3:** Stores uploaded images in a secure and scalable manner.

## Functionality

* **GET:** Retrieves a list of image URLs.
* **DELETE:** Delete an image from the S3 bucket.

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** AWS Lambda, API Gateway
* **Storage:** Amazon S3
* **Deployment:** AWS Amplify
* **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch
* **Security:** AWS IAM

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

* **frontend:** Contains the frontend code and assets.
* **backend (on AWS only):** Includes Lambda functions, API Gateway configuration, and Infrastructure as Code templates.
